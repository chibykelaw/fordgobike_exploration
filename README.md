# Ford GoBike Data Exploration
## by Chibuike Lawrence Orji-Oko


## Dataset

This is an exploration of the Ford GoBike dataset. 

The Ford GoBike Dataset consists of information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering greater San Francisco. 

The data features include duration (secs) and others such as DateTime, customer type, gender, and some additional variables. 

There are 183412 rides (rows) in the dataset with 16 features (columns). There are 2 datetime, 4 float, 2 integer, 6 string (object) and 2 categorical variables. 


## Summary of Findings

**In the data exploration, the following discoveries were made:**

Most of the Ford GoBike users are subscribers (89.2%). The majority of the rides are under 30 minutes.

The most busy hours are during the rush hours of a day, between the hours of 7AM and 9AM when people are going to work, and between the hours of 4PM and 6PM when people are returning back from work.

Thursdays have the hightest trips, followed by Tuedays. While weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) have the lowest rides.

Most riders are males. 75.74% of the users of the Ford GoBike system are males while 22.27% are females. Those that filled "other" as gender account for 1.99% of the total rides.

Non bike-sharing is preferred more than bike-sharing. Customers on the average take longer trips than subscribers. Saturday, Monday, and Sunday have the hightest trip duration compared to other days of the week.

Those who indicated "other" as their gender group travels for a longer duration for both bike sharing and non bike sharing, followed by the female group, while, the male gender are the least. Subscribers use Ford GoBike for short distance travels while customers take longer rides.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, focus is on the user type, trip duration, and frequencies of rides per hour and day. 

I began by checking the distribution of users between customer and subscriber type, then trip duration distribution to find out most busy hours and busy days in a week. 

Next, I looked at the distribution and relationship of each of the various categorical variables using point plots.
